v3.8
====

misc
----

* Add ``urxvt-unicode-256color`` as a possible value for ``$TERM`` when
  trying to figure out whether color output should be enabled
* Setting terminal title now works on Mac and Windows
* Add ``XDG`` base directory support

qibuild
-------

* Unify build configs: now a build config has a name, a toolchain and a list
  of profiles. A build dir matches exactly one build config. Build directories
  are the same when building in release or in debug.

  To do the transition, you should create at least one config per toolchain,
  for instance:

  .. code-block:: console

     qibuild add-config nao --toolchain atom --profile nao

  Then use

  .. code-block:: console

     qibuild configure -c nao

  As a consequence, the ``-p, --profile`` option is gone, and
  ``--release`` can only be used for ``qibuild configure``

* Add ``qibuild add-config``, ``qibuild list-configs``, ``qibuild rm-config``

* ``qibuild clean``: fix when using remote profiles
* ``qibuild init``: honor ``-w, --worktree`` option
* Re-implement setting a custom build prefix. (The feature was gone since qibuild 3.0)

  To use this feature, write something like:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <qibuild>
      <build prefix="my-build" />
    </qibuild>

  in ``/path/to/worktree/.qi/qibuild.xml``

  You can also use ``--build-prefix`` in your calls to ``qibuild configure``,
  ``qibuild make`` and so on.

  Note that the old syntax, using ``<build build_dir="my-build>`` is no longer
  supported.

  Also note that the build directories that will be created will be like
  ``<prefix>/<project>/<build-dir>`` instead of ``<prefix>/<build-dir>/project``

* Changes in handling dependencies to packages in the toolchain:

  * ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` is set in the ``dependencies.cmake`` file,
    no longer in the generated toolchain file

  * Optionally use ``qiproject.xml`` information instead of adding every path
    of every package in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``

    (This behavior is triggered by setting the
    ``QIBUILD_STRICT_DEPS_RESOLUTION`` environment variable for now, but will
    be the default in the next release)


* ``qibuild find``: fix return code when no CMake module is found
* Fix using ``-j`` with ``Visual Studio`` generators.
* Include toolchain paths in path.conf
* ``qibuild``: generate ``qitest.json`` file also after building
* Store default config for worktree in the global config file
  (``~/.config/qi/qibuild.xml``)

qidoc
------

* Implement ``qidoc build --spellcheck``, using
  `sphinxcontrib-spelling <http://sphinxcontrib-spelling.readthedocs.org/>`_
* Fix parsing of ``+=`` assignments in ``Doxyfile.in``

qilinguist
-----------

* Fail when non-translated messages are found
  (``qilinguist release`` learned ``--allow-untranslated-messages`` to get back
  the old behavior)
* ``qilinguist release`` can also work with ``.pml`` files.
* ``qilinguist list``: sort by project name

qipkg
-----

* ``qipkg deploy-package``: Remove previous instance before installing
* Add ``qipkg bump-version``
* ``qipkg make-package /path/to/pml``: also works when not in a worktree
* ``qipkg make-package``: handle translations files from ``.pml``
* Make it possible to use ``qipkg`` without a worktree
* Stop generating ``.mpkg`` files when using ``.mpml`` files. Instead
  generate several ``.pkg``
* ``qipkg install PML_PATH DEST``: add ``--pkg`` to generate and install
  ``.pkg`` files to the given destination
* ``qipkg install``: also install the manifest

qipy
----

* Raise when empty projects are found

qisrc
------

* ``qisrc rebase``: several fixes

  * Only work on forked projects
  * Fix computation of git status before trying the rebase
  * Prettier output

* ``qisrc create``: add ``-i,--template-path`` argument. This
  allows users to create their own templates

* ``qisrc create``: better handling of ``"/"`` in argument
* ``qisrc grep``: fix using git grep options such as
  ``qisrc grep -- -i foo``
* ``qisrc sync``: fix return code when some projects are skipped
* Implements ``qisrc sync --reset``
* ``qisrc init``, ``qisrc sync``: fix return code when cloning new repositories fails
* ``qisrc init``: re-implement ``--no-review``, which was gone since ``3.0``
* Fix using ``qisrc checkout --force`` when not on a branch
* Fix using ``qisrc init --worktree``
* ``qisrc checkout --force``: fix when not on any branch


qitest
------

* Implement ``qitest run --break-on-failure``
* Fix error messages in some corner cases
* Fix several race conditions when using ``-j``
* Implement ``qitest run --root-output-dir`` to store generated XML files
  outside the sdk directory

qitoolchain
-----------

* No longer writes files in ``~/.cache/qi/toolchains``
* Also remove package files when a package is removed from the feed
* ``qitoolchain add-package``: support legacy format
* Allow including or excluding files with masks when installing packages

cmake
------

* modules:

  * ``ogre``: search in the right ``PATH_SUFFIX``
  * Add ``v4l``
  * Add ``Qt5X11Extras``
  * Support ``opencv`` 2.4.10

* ``qi_swig_wrap_python``: handle lower case DEPENDS arguments
* ``qi_install_python``: fix default destination on Windows
* ``qt-tools``: add ``qi_set_qt_plugin_properties``
