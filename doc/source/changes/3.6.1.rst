v3.6.1
======

CMake
------

* ``qi_generate_qt_conf``: fix for Mac
* ``qt-tools``: do not call ``find_package(Qt4)``
* modules:

  * add ``tbb``
  * add ``opencv2_ocl``

qibuild
-------

* Fix ``qibuild configure`` in some corner cases

    We used to only write the dependencies.cmake file only for build
    and runtime depends, causing `qibuild configure` to fail when
    using test time dependencies

qisrc
-----

* qisrc reset: bug fix when using groups

    Previously we were building the list of git
    projects *before* having updated the manifest,
    causing some projects to not be reset at all.
