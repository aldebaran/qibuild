Using toolchains
================

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your projects using pre-compiled
packages.


Using Aldebaran toolchains
---------------------------

Aldebaran C++ SDKs and cross-toolchains are, by definition, toolchains.

Using them is done with

.. code-block:: console

   $ qitoolchain create <name> /path/to/toolchain.xml

.. seealso:: :ref:`qibuild-using-aldebaran-packages`



Adding packages to a toolchain
------------------------------

Requirements
++++++++++++

The requirements for this tutorial are the same as in
the :ref:`qibuild-managing-deps` tutorial.

You should have:

* a properly configured qiBuild worktree

* two projects, world and hello, with hello depending on the world library.

You can find these two projects here :download:`helloworld.zip </samples/helloworld.zip>`

The goal of this tutorial is to manage to compile ``hello``, using a pre-compiled
binary of ``world``.

Creating the world package
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Generating a package for the ``world`` project is done with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qibuild package world

This will create a package named ``world.tar.gz`` in
``QI_WORK_TREE/package/world.tar.gz`` (or ``world.tar.gz`` on windows)

Inside the package, you will have::

  include
    |__ world
        |__ world.hpp
  lib
        |__ libworld.so
  share
     cmake
        |__ world-config.cmake
  package.xml


.. note:: The archive generated by qibuild does not contain
   a top directory, so be careful if you extract the archive
   by hand.
   Use ``qitoolchain extract-package`` to put the extracted files
   in a properly named directory

The LFS hierarchy is still preserved, and it is the same as in ``build/sdk``.

The ``world-config.cmake`` is a standard CMake file, but it can be used even after
installing the world package, because it only uses relative paths.

So the world package is usable anywhere.

.. note:: The world-config.cmake does not even requires qibuild to be used by
  an other CMake project, all it does is calling standard CMake functions.

Create a toolchain from scratch
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are already using a Aldebaran toolchain, you can skip this section.

Otherwise, you have to create a **toolchain** from scratch for qibuild to use:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qitoolchain create <TOOLCHAIN_NAME>

You are free to choose any name for your toolchain, but it is advised
to pick one from this set of configurations:

* linux32
* linux64
* mac32
* mac64
* win32-vs2008
* win32-vs2010
* mingw

Here we will assume you chose ``linux32``.

This will create a directory looking like:
``~/.local/share/qi/toolchains/linux32/``
where every packages will be put.

You can check that your toolchain has been created with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ qitoolchain info

   Toolchain linux32
   No feed
   No packages


Adding the world package to the toolchain
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can use:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qitoolchain add-package -c linux32 /path/to/worktree/package/world.tar.gz

You can check that your package has been added with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qitoolchain info

  Toolchain linux32
  No feed
    Packages:
      world
        in /home/user/.local/share/qi/toolchains/linux32/world


This will simply:

* copy the ``world`` package somewhere in you toolchain directory.

* configure some files so that qibuild knows that the
  ``linux32`` toolchain can provide the ``world`` package

When resolving dependencies of the ``hello`` project, qibuild will see that you
use a toolchain called ``linux32`` and that this toolchain provides the
``world`` project, so it’s enough to set ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATHS`` to
``path/to/linux/toolchain/world``

The next step is to create a build config that matches the toolchain
for qibuild to use:

.. code-block:: console

    qibuild add-config linux32 --toolchain linux32

You can now remove the project ``world`` from your worktree, and
configure ``hello`` using the ``linux32`` build config:

.. code-block:: console

    qisrc remove world
    qibuild configure -c linux32 hello


Creating toolchain feeds
------------------------

Now, that you have a nice local toolchain, and a ``world`` package,
you may want other people to be able to use the ``world`` package,
without them having to recompile it from source.

So here we are going to create a remote configuration file, so
that other developers can simply download the ``world`` package from
a server.

We will assume you have access to a FTP or a HTTP sever.


First, upload the world package, so that is accessible with the url:
``http://example.com/packages/world.tar.gz``

Next, create a ``feed.xml`` accessible with the url:
``http://example.com/feed.xml``, looking like

.. code-block:: xml

  <toolchain>

    <package
      name="world"
      url = "http://example.com/packages/world.tar.gz"
    />

  </toolchain>


Then, from an other machine, run

.. code-block:: console

  $ qitoolchain create linux32 http://example.com/feed.xml

  Getting package world from http://example.com/packages/world.tar.gz
  Toolchain linux32: adding package world


You can see that the feed has been stored in your qibuild configuration:

.. code-block:: console

  $ qitoolchain info

  Toolchain linux32
  Using feed from http://example.com/feed.xml
    Packages:
      foo
        in /home/user/.local/share/qi/toolchains/linux32/world


Note: if you HTTP or FTP server is protected by a password, you can put
the username and password in the ``.config/qi/qibuild.xml`` configuration file.

See the section :ref:`qibuild-xml-syntax` for details.

You can also add the Aldebaran C++ SDKs or cross toolchains as if they were packages.
(This sound a bit weird, but it works)

For instance, assuming you were using the atom cross-toolchain and cross-compiled
the world package, you can create a feed looking like

.. code-block:: xml

   <toolchain>
    <package name="atom-ctc"  url="http://example.com/packages/aldebaran-ctc.tar.gz"
      toolchain_file="cross-config.cmake" />

    <package name="hello"  url="http://example.com/packages/world.tar.gz" />
  </toolchain>


Don't forget the ``toolchain_file`` attribute of the ``atom-ctc`` package, though.


Full feed.xml specification
----------------------------

The full specification can be found in the
:ref:`toolchain-feed-syntax` section


Just for fun
------------

You can always add something like

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="../xsl/toolchain.xsl"?>


With an xsl looking like


.. code-block:: xml

  <html xsl:version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <body >
      <h2> Packages </h2>
      <ul>
        <xsl:for-each select="toolchain/package">
        <li>
          <a>
          <xsl:attribute name="href">
            <xsl:value-of select="@url" />
          </xsl:attribute>
          <xsl:value-of select="@name" />
          </a>
        </li>
        </xsl:for-each>
      </ul>
      <h2> Feeds </h2>
      <ul>
        <xsl:for-each select="toolchain/feed">
        <li>
          <a>
          <xsl:attribute name="href">
            <xsl:value-of select="@url" />
          </xsl:attribute>
          <xsl:value-of select="@url" />
          </a>
        </li>
        </xsl:for-each>
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>
