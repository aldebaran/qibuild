""" This modules contains few functions around subprocess


Few notes:

 - for each command, we try to look the executable in PATH,
 (also using %PATHEXT% on windows), raising a NotInPath exception when
 not found.

 This way:
     We can alway use:
        - qibuild.command.call(["cmake", ..."])
    on every platform as soon as cmake is in
    os.environ["PATH"]

    without:
       - using shell=True
        (although we can display it in our error message)
       - caring about the fact that it in fact "cmake.exe" on windows:
    but:
        - still using native, absolute paths for the executables we run.
        (which is nice when debugging)

    Note that on windows, you can specify paths to add to %PATH% in
    qibuild configuration file, without polluting you whole
    environment.

 - Unless explicitly told not to, we alway raise an exception when
 the return code of the command is not zero.
     Return code always matter when you are building software ;-)
