r""" This module contains the EnvSetter class,
designed to take care of environment variables.

import qibuild

class EnvSetter():
    r""" A class to manager environment variables

    Typical usage::

        envsetter = EnvSetter()
        envsetter.append_to_path(r"c:\path\to\cmake")
        envsetter.set_env_var("WITH_SPAM", "ON")
        envsetter.source_bat(r"C:\path\to\vcvars.bat")
        build_env = envsetter.get_build_env()
        # build_env is now a *copy* of os.environ, os.environ does
        # NOT change
        qibuild.command.call("cmake", env=build_env)

    Note1: this will work even in cmake was not in %PATH% before,
    because we will use build_env when searching for 'cmake'.
    see qibuild.command.call documentation

    Note2: this is a nice way to set cmake (or git) in a config file
    withouth to mess up with %PATH% on windows

    Note3: the source_bat() function is mandatory to use cl.exe and
    NMake Makefiles. (you usually have to source vsvarsall.bat)
