== QiBuild major classes ==

=== QiWorkTree ===
Hold general information about a worktree:
  - buildable_projects
  - git_projects
  - configuration

=== Toc(QiWorkTree) ===
Hold build specific information about projects. You should specify everything needed for a build to this class.
This include:
  - the toolchain name (default to "system")
  - the build type (release/debug)
  - the build configuration (default to "")
  - specifics cmake flags (default to None)

=== Project ===
Hold build information about a project. This include:
  - name
  - directory
  - build_directory
  - sdk_directory
  - depends
  - rdepends




=== Build: what do we need? ===
- the list of project the user requested to build (we ALWAYS want to build them).
  We can check that user provided projets are found and buildable.
- we have toc.buildable_projects : the list of ALL buildable projects
- we have toc.toolchain.packages : the list of binary packages the user choosen using qitoolchain add/remove


=== Use case ===
# normal workflow: build specified project, and a use a mix of buildable and package for dependencies
qibuild make <pj1> <pj2>
- should always build pj1 and pj2.
- should fail if all deps are not found either buildable or packages. (except in the system toolchain)
- should try it's best to use packages(user specified) instead of buildable

# normal workflow: build only the specified project (use a mix of buildable and packages for dependencies),
# but do not interact with other buildable project
qibuild make --single <pj1>
-
- build pj1, do not reconfigure or build buildable dependencies

=== Use case ===
qitoolchain update -a
qibuild configure
qibuild make



== What to test ==

- DependenciesSolver():

  only need fake Project.
  -> projects (.depends and .rdepends)
  -> packages
  -> args (single, all)

  -> resolve(project_list):

  -> resolve(project_list, single=True)

- Project(debug=True)
  check that -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG is in project.flags

- qibuild {configure, make, install, package}
  (need a *real* toc object and *real* sources)
